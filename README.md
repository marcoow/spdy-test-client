# SPDY Test client

A simple client that requests data from a
[SPDY server](https://github.com/marcoow/spdy-test-server).

To build the project, first install the required pods:

```
bundle exec pod
```

To run the app you need to install the CA certificate by opening
https://raw.github.com/marcoow/spdy-test-server/master/nginx/ca.crt
in the simulator's browser.
